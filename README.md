# OPERATION COOP

## Play the game!
You can play the game here: https://thegoodhen.github.io/Operation-coop/

## Controls and gameplay
Use your arrow keys to move and Enter to restart. The chicken gets tired after flying for prolonged periods of time.
Make sure to allow it to rest from time to time by staying on the ground! 
You can see how tired the chicken is by looking on her face. Avoid the snowmen, anvils thrown by Santa and the flame of his rocket.
Try not letting any present get past you! This increases your combo, which in turn makes your score increase faster!
The transparent tree on the bottom left of the screen is your combo indicator.


## Story
The F.B.I. agency (Feathered Biped Intelligence) has uncovered the fascinating truth!
Santa is real!!

Since Santa Claus is a magical creature,
there is a chance that there is some magic technology hidden inside his presents.
And if not, well, the presents can always be sold to help with the F.B.Is budgeting!
This gave birth to the secret Operation C.O.O.P (Capture Otherworldy and Other Presents).
Collect as many presents as you can to help the F.B.I. ! 

# About
The game is inspired by one of the first games I ever created (when I was around 15 years old), "Jetpack Santa".
In this game, you are a ghost with snow-powered jetpack, who is trying to collect as many presents as possible. 
The jetpack runs out of water and refills immediately upon landing.
The basic concept is kept, but updated with improved gameplay, superior graphics and written from scratch for web browsers,
unlike the original game, which is written using Game Maker.

## Credits
The game was made using P5.play.js
The snow particle system is taken from Coding train, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-mHFCGzYk&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain
The music was taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxfBBa9kdkA&ab_channel=ScottHolmesMusic
The chicken character is based on an image I generated using the Stable Diffusion AI.
Some small parts of the code (i.e. the seeded pseudorandom generator) were written by GPT4.

The rest of the code, animations, graphics and sounds are by me.
